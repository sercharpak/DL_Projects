## EEG - BCI - Project
The first project ([here](https://github.com/sercharpak/DL_Projects/tree/master/EEG-BCI-Project/)) consisted on re-doing one of the 
BCI challenges (with EEG data) of predicting laterality of finger movement 
using DL state of the art techinques.

## Basic DL Framework
The second project ([here](https://github.com/sercharpak/DL_Projects/tree/master/Basic-DL-Framework-Project/)) consisted on implementing a DL 
framework from scratch and comparing it to pytorch. The constraint consisted 
on being only able to use the Tensor object from Pytorch.
